        <p class="intro">
          Ever since my first stay at the Mathanguri FRH in the Manas N.P , I have
          been fantasying a visit to the mist covered hills of the Royal Manas N.P. that by across Manas River deep
          into central Bhutan.
          <br>
          Fantasy changed to reality when my good friend and birding companion Amit Bandekar of Goa first proposed
          this unique birding adventure which will enable us to cut through the heart of Royal Manas N.P. of Bhutan
          into the Manas N.P. of India across International border. Amit and his better half Madhura got the
          conversation going with forest officials of Bhutan regarding permits and feasible program schedules. Once
          that itinerary to match our requirements.

        </p>

        <p>
          The ball set rolling on the 9th of Feb 2014 when Amit’s flight touch down at Bagdogra. After a quick lunch we
          were at full throttle towards Bangaigaon in Assam which is some 320 kms from the Bagdogra Airport.
          We drove more or less continuously before we broke for tea at sundown. Along the drive we spotted
          Black-shouldered Kite, Ring Dove, Red-collared Dove, Stork-billed and Pied Kingfishers, Scaly-breasted
          Munias, Small Green & Blue-tailed Bee-eaters etc. apart from the common varieties of Mynas & Starlings.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we arrived at Bongaigaon around 7:30pm, the Manager at the hotel informed us about a “Bandh” that has
          been called by an extremist outfit and that we had to make it to the highway by 6:00 am next morning to avoid
          being stranded. The fatigue of the day-long drive crushed us to bed right after the dinner.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div id="day2" class="col-md-12">
        <p class="highlight trip-header-text text-center clearfix"><span class="float-left">Day 2</span> <span class="float-right">10
            January,&nbsp;2014</span></p>

        <p>
          The alarm clocks of our mobile phones went off at 4:00. With blurry eyes and dizzy feet we hopped on to the
          vehicle and started for the highway. The gas was filled, tea was taken and after a couple direction queries
          with the Highway Patrol Stuff, when we were finally on our way towards Gelephu on the Bhutanese border it was
          almost day break.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to Amit’s meticulous planning, the Forest Official of Royal Manas NP was waiting for us at the gates
          and got us through to the Foreigner Registration office in no time. As we were waiting for the completion of
          the formalities, I had been enjoying some very close views of the Red-rumped Swallow, a pair of which were
          gathering mud particles to their nest nearby.
        </p>
        <p>
          On completion of registration, we bid goodbye to this pretty town and headed to the hills towards Tingtibi.
          Just after taking to the hills, the birdlife started to flourish. This stretch from Gelephu to Tingtibi was
          good for Long-tailed & Rufous Sibia, Orange-bellied& Gold-fronted Leafbirds, Grey-backed Shrike,
          Yellow-bellied & White-throated Fantail etc. Among Yuhinas, Whiskered & Rufous-vented were more common.
          The roadside nullahs and small streams produced both Spotted & Slaty-backed Forktails along with Plumbeous
          and White-capped Water Redstarts. Olive-backed Pipits and Oriental Turtle Doves were more common on the road
          while the vegetation provided good views of Great & Golden-throated Barbet and both Chestnut-bellied &
          White-tailed Nuthatches.

        </p>
        <p>
          About an hour before reaching Tingtibi, minutes after I had stopped for a smoko, the sight of bee-hives on a
          big rock-face caught our eye.
        </p>

          <p class="highlight3 image-caption">Bee hives on the rocky walls</p>

        </div>
        <p>
          Immediately we got off and started to scan the area around the hives. And there it was; quietly perched on a
          slender branch, the rare Yellow-rumped Honeyguide. We spent some good 45 minutes observing and photographing
          this rarity before we hit the road again for Tingtibi.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          At Tingtibi, our birding guide was waiting for us with a pre-booked lunch at a local eatery. We devoured the
          food in no time and without losing further more minutes we started for Gompu. It was a fabulous drive along
          the upper stage of the turbulent Mangde Chhu. We were told that this area was good for Wallcreeper, though we
          didn’t see one, probably because of the wrong end of the day. When we reached Gomphu it was almost late
          evening.
          The range Officer and the local helps gave us a warm welcome on arrival.

        </div>
        <p>
          We were guided to our respective cottages, the bonfire was lit and hot dinner of typical Bhutanese cuisine
          was served. After spending half an hour by the fire we retired to start afresh on the next day.

        <p>
          We started our morning birding venture with very close views of the Asian Barred Owlet. As we proceeded down
          the trail, the bird activities increased. A big flock of Greater Rufous-headed Parrotbill greeted us, and
          accompanying them were a couple of gorgeous Coral-billed Scimitar Babblers.
          After another hundred miters we had our first view of a female Rufous-necked Hornbill, busy feeding on
          berries. Hiking for a few more minutes, we came to a landslide zone, where the Blue-winged Laughingthrush
          provided us with sufficient times for observation. N the way back we sited another Rufous-necked Hornbill,
          this time a mail, and had good views of the Mountain Hawk Eagle.

          Among the other birds sighted during the morning walk included Greater Yellownape, Scarlet Minivet,
          Blue-bearded Bee-eater, Rufous-necked Laughingthrush, striated Bulbul, Mountain Bulbul, Ashy bulbul, Grey
          Bushchat, Large Niltava, Rufous-gorgeted Flycatcher etc.

        </p>
        <p>
          The afternoon walk gave us a prize view of the Red Headed Trogon and Kaleej Pheasant. The ended with great
          views of Black-faced Warbler and Yellow-cheeked Tit.

        <p>
          We started our second morning at Gomphu with close views of the White-crested Laughingthrush and Blue
          whistling thrush over our cups of Morning Tea. As we stepped out of the camp we were mate with a rather
          daring flock of Bhutan Laughingthrush.

        </p>
        <p>
          Not to be left far behind where a few Rusty-cheeked Scimitar Babblers. Out on the trail, we encountered
          couple of mixed hunting parties comprising mainly of Yuhina’s, Phyloscopus Warblers and Black-eared shrike
          Babbler.
          Proceeding further down the trail where we met our bird of the day, the extremely shy Red-faced Liocichla,
          which fascinated us with great views. Accompanying closely was a flock of Blue-winged Laughingthrush. On the
          way back to the camp we stopped by the Gumpa of the village.
          Behind the Gumpa we found Rufous-necked Laughingthrush, Eurasian Tree Sparrow and Blue Whistling Thrush in
          closed quarters.

          Post lunch session birding started with the Streaked-breasted Scimitar Babbler and a flock of White-crested
          Laughingthrush. Other birds sighted during the following afternoon were Red-headed Trogon, Small Niltava,
          Blue-winged Laughingthrush, Blue-fronted Redstart and Rusty Fronted Barwing.

        </p>
        <p>
          Since this was our last evening at Gomphu, we got busy in getting the evening party going. Fried Sausages
          with salad mixed with a batter of local cheese which Mousumi took a bit of trouble in preparing were a
          perfect blend with the Oban Single Malt that Amit had carried all way from Goa. Chatting by the bonfire went
          on for quite some time into the night.

        <p>
          After an early breakfast we bid good bye to our local hosts, and hit the road once again. Only after a few
          minutes’ drive we were a stopped by a group of White-crested Laughingthrush foraging on the road. Some way
          ahead, again we came to halt by bird activities.
          This time there was a mixed flock of Nepal Fulvetta, White-spectacle Warbler and Grey-throated Babbler. Some
          way down we had a distant view of the Rufous-necked Hornbill. The dart road ended on the main road to
          Pantang. At this point our birding guide bid us good buy. We were on our own again.

        </p>
        <div id="image" class="col-md-12 text-center">

          It was a beautiful day. Bright sunshine, views of the thick forested ridges of the Royal Manas N.P., a breath
          taking landscape and a freshly laid tarmac made this drive one the most memorable ones to cherish.

        </p>
        <p>
          It was a bit difficult to keep a check on the accelerator on such a lavish road. We were actually speeding a
          bit when Amit’s eye caught something, and we came to a halt. It was a Crested Hawk Eagle perched high up on
          the cliff. We got down and walked ahead scanning the trees and landscape. Near one of the curves we saw
          barren tree with bit odd looking leaves a closure inspection revealed that they were a whole lot of
          Spot-winged Grosbeak’s.
          Further down the road we had fantastic views of a small flock of Scarlet Finch and some good views of Brown
          Bulfinch. Near Panbang we spent some time scanning the river edges for Ibisbill but in vain.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          Beyond Panbang, driving through some of the most amazing landscape we are gradually getting closure to the
          Indian border. Along this route we had a close affair with a rather reluctant Blue-bearded Bee-eater while
          Slaty-backed Forktail was rather common along the small water sources. We finally finished the formalities at
          the last Bhutanese Check post at Pantang and started towards Mothanguri in the Indian side of Manas.
          On the way we stopped at a small waterfall where we had good view of Brown dipper and a pair of Collared
          Falconets.

        <p>
          With the change in altitude the species variety around us started changing. We started seeing species like
          White-rumped Shama, White-throated Bulbul etc. A familiar smell was in the air, the fragrance of our
          motherland was getting stronger with every passing minute. Finally our Scorpio drove passed the Bhutanese
          gate and came to a halt before the Mothanguri FRH.
